# Title: Airport Passenger Check-in Simulation 

## Team Member(s): Nishi Mehta|Devansh Gandhi

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

With increasing number of people traveling both domestic and international,efficient operation of an airport system to minimize customer inconvenience becomes an important issue.Since it is very important to consider customer satisfaction in a service sector, using simulation at these places to help study and reduce customer waiting times or process times seems plausible.
Rockford Airport is a medium capacity airport facility that usually operates one flight at a time.We are performing simulation analysis on various sectors such as Passenger Check-in and Baggage Screening.

Various scenarios were set up to study the effects of multiple flights, number of passengers on flight, number of check-in agents and the baggage screening mode.The simulation cases considered are as follows:

• First case is evaluated on the baggage screening procedure using an automatic machine.The variable parameters are the number of passengers on the flight and the number of check-in agents to use.Also,eclectic output parameters such as average waiting time for passengers and the utilization of check-in counters are to be observed.

•Second case is evaluated on the condition of changing the number of passengers on the flight and also the number of check-in agents.It is done for the automatic baggage screening process and for a single flight only.

•Third case is evaluated on the basis of changing the number of passengers on each flight and the number of check-in agents.


## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
Variable 1: Number of passengers on the flight

Variable 2: Number of check-in agents

Variable 3: Number of flights

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

To be decided later after the initial structure of the code.

## Instructions on how to use the program:
