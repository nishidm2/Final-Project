# Title: Airport Passenger Check-in Simulation 

## Team Member(s): Nishi Mehta|Devansh Gandhi

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

With increasing number of people traveling both domestic and international,efficient operation of an airport system to minimize customer inconvenience becomes an important issue.Since it is very important to consider customer satisfaction in a service sector, using simulation at these places to help study and reduce customer waiting times or process times seems plausible.
Rockford Airport is a medium capacity airport facility that usually operates one flight at a time.We are performing simulation analysis on sectors such as Passenger Check-in.

Various scenarios were set up to study the effects of multiple flights, number of passengers on flight & number of check-in agents.The simulation cases considered are as follows:

• First case is evaluated on varying the time each check-in agent takes to serve each passenger.The variable parameters are the number of passengers on the flight.Also,different output parameters such as average waiting time for passengers and the utilization of check-in counters are to be observed.

•Second case is evaluated on the condition of changing the number of passengers on the flight and also the number of check-in agents.It is for a single flight only.

•Third case is evaluated on the basis of changing the number of flights along with the number of passengers and check-in agents.


## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
Variable 1: Agent rate and number o0f passengers on one flight.

Variable 2: Number of check-in agents and passengers.

Variable 3: Number of flights.

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
We considered the following hyposthesis:
1)The average waiting time decreases as the number of check-in counters increases.
2)Also, as the number of passengers increases, the waiting time in the queue increases.
This is evident from the results obtained and the graphical display using uniform distribution.


## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

Some analysis we could conclude upon from the above simulation are as follows:
1)The average waiting time decreases as the number of check-in counters increases.
2)Our hypothesis that if the number of passengers increases, the waiting time also increases is proved to be true in the results accrued.
3)The above simulation explains that more check-in agents should be incorporated if there is a huge rush of passengers at the airport.
